# Hi there 👋, I'm Syarwina 😊

I'm a Final Year Biomedical Engineering and Data Science & Analytics student at NUS with a keen interest in MedTech, HealthTech, BioTech, and pretty much anything with "Tech" in it. I spend my time tinkering on various projects, both solo and with awesome teams, and you can find the evidence of my experiments in my GitHub repositories 🛠️💻.

When I'm not buried in code or lecture notes 📚, you'll likely find me escaping into the world of gaming 🎮. I swing between the serene vibes of Stardew Valley 🌻 and the (extremely) toxic realms of League of Legends 🔥. Balance, right? 😅
