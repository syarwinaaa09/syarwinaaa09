## 🧬 About Me

- **👨‍🎓 Education:** Pursuing a degree in Biomedical Engineering with a side quest in Data Science & Analytics.
- **🔬 Research Interests:** Making sense of chaotic biological data, one algorithm at a time.
- **☕ Fun Fact:** I survive on coffee and the excitement of finding that one elusive bug.

## 🛠 Skills

- **Languages:** Python, R, MATLAB, Fluent in Biomed Jargon
- **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, SciPy
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebooks, Git, Excel (because, why not?)
- **Special Powers:** Debugging code at 3 AM, Finding correlations in chaos

## 🌟 Projects

- **Analyze the Popularity of Programming Languages:** 📊 analyzing programming language trends (2008–2020) using Stack Overflow data with R 📈
- **Automated Detection of Diabetic Retinopathy:** seeing is believing, and detecting diabetic retinopathy early can save vision 👓

My projects are like a lab experiment – always evolving and occasionally exploding. Check back later for more data-driven adventures!

## 🏆 Achievements

- Built a neural network that can identify cats in MRI scans. 
- Survived multiple all-nighters with minimal caffeine-induced jitters.
- Got a dataset to cooperate without using any threats (mostly).

## 🎉 Fun Facts

- I once trained a model to differentiate between jazz and classical music using only EEG signals.
- My idea of a fun weekend is debugging code while binging on medical dramas.
- I've written more lines of code than I have taken breaths during exams.
