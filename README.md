# Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I'm Syarwina :)

A Year 4 Biomedical Engineering and Data Science & Analytics Undergraduate at NUS who has an interest in MedTech, HealthTech, BioTech etc. I like to work on random projects either by myself or with a team and these can be found in my GitHub repositories.

In my free time, I like to game. My range goes from cozy games like Stardew Valley to (extremely) toxic ones like League of Legends.
